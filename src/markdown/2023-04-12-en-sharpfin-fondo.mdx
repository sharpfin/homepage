Our solution will meet wealth managers' needs for modern technology that provides a better customer experience and at the same time remove unnecessary administration and lowers management costs.

"<em>When talking to advisors and wealth managers, it is becoming increasingly clear that the industry lacks a fully digitized solution for fund custody, fund trading and client onboarding. We are happy to have found a cooperation partner in Fondo, with whom we have created a completely digital solution, with a quick time to market that solves a critical problem for our customers.</em>" - Markus Alin, VD Sharpfin.

The new solution is built upon a full integration between Sharpfin's portfolio system and Fondo's digital custody and fund trading platform, where the entire advisory process becomes fully digitized in one and the same interface.

The integration also means streamlined management with real-time updates of end customers' depots and automated back office without the need to outsource essential operations.

“<em>We are currently working full speed to go live with our first customer. After that, we have a number of ongoing dialogues with a number of well reputed wealth management companies. It is clear that there is a demand for digital solutions and modern technology in the industry.</em>”  - Olof Cristoferson, CEO Fondo.

Through this joint offering, wealth managers will be empowered with access to a modern customer interface and a wide range of funds, where all commissions are refunded to the end customer.
